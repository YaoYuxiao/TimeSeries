### Task

To predict the monthly average of CO2 level from Mauna Loa Observatory in November, 2019.

**Result: our predicted monthly average 𝐶𝑂2 level in November, 2019 is 410.23 ppm. The real value measured by the Earth System Research Laboratory is 410.27 ppm.**

### Background

* Mauna Loa, Hawaii
  + One of the ﬁve volcanos that form the island of Hawaii. 
  + Elevation: 13,679 feet above sea level. 
  + 40 miles to the nearest city, Hilo.

* NOAA Mauna Loa Observatory
  + Located at the 11,141 feet level on Mauna Loa.
  + World’s oldest continuous (daily report) air monitoring station.
  + Far from any continent, and the air sampled is a good average for the central Paciﬁc.
  + Above the inversion layer where most local eﬀects are present.
  + We will focus on the most important greenhouse gas: Carbon Dioxide.
  
* Keeling Curve
  + Named after Charles D. Keeling (1928–2005) Started monitoring CO2 at MLO from 1958. 
  + Funding was ceased in 1960s and research was called “routine.” 
  + First alerted the world about the “greenhouse eﬀect” and global warming. 
  + Longest continuous record of atmospheric CO2 level. 
  + Keeling was awarded the National Medal of Science for his great work.
  
### Dataset

We will use datasets retrieved from: http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/. 

### Methods

We will use time series packages in R to do analysis and prediction.
